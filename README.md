# 🚀 RAG Workshop: Build Your Own AI-Powered Q&A App!
Welcome to the RAG Workshop! This repository is your starting point to dive into the world of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Whether you're curious about how RAG works, how to optimize it, or how to build cool AI-powered chat apps, you're in the right place!


## What You'll Learn
In this workshop, you'll:

- **Build a RAG system from scratch:** Learn how to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution, covering everything from prompting to the basics of setting up a vector database.
- **Master the art of prompting:** Discover how to craft prompts that effectively guide your RAG models for optimal results.
- **Work on a real-world project:** Bring it all together by building a Q&A chat app for books using Streamlit. 

While the workshop focuses on books, the skills you'll gain are versatile and applicable to various scenarios, such as improving productivity of customer support by enabling querying policies or analysing customer reviews. RAG empowers language models by enriching them with domain-specific knowledge to tackle diverse tasks.


## Project Structure
Here's what you'll find in this repository:

- 📂 data: All the datasets you need to work through the exercises. You can also bring your own PDFs for a more personal touch!
- 📓 notebooks: Step-by-step guides to get you up and running with RAG basics.
- 💬 chat: The final chat application you'll build after completing the notebooks. 

The final app could look like this:
